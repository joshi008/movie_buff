Alright so the fundamental purpose of this project is to build a robust movie recommendation system. 

This will be achieved first by scraping notable movie review sites 
And applying Machine Learning techniques(to be decided later) to learn the relation between similar movies on the basis of their reviews produced 

Scrapers for the following sites need to built(not exhaustive, feel free to add to this list)

1) IMDB
2) Rotten Tomatoes
3) Roger Ebert
4) Guardian
5) Meta Critic
